`root` is the only and ultimate one before any user comes into being. Just like how god created human beings, root starts working:

	useradd -m -s /bin/bash jeffreyleeli
	passwd jeffreyleeli

So that's me, and I've got my own name, while use your own on your side, with password needed when diving into this fantastic OS world.

BTW with -m option, my home is set at `/home/jeffreyleeli`, while with -s option, root has given me bash as the talking channel with the MATRIX.
