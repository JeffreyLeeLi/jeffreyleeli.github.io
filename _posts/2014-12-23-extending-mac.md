## SSD: Make it Run

With `run`, I mean in opposite to `walk`.

Replace SuperDrive with SSD HD, preserving original hard disk.

## Thunderbolt -> VGA + DVI + HDMI

If not used this way, I rarely use the minidp port at all.

## USB Brancher: 4 in 1

I got additional mouse, keyboard for extended screen. I have to connect to iPhone, Raspberry Pi, and maybe an Android Phone.

All use USB ports. MacBook Pro only got 2 in total.

Let USB Brancher come to help.

## Firewire

Have not got any good ideas, any recommendations?
