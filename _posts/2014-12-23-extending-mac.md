## SSD: Make it Run

With `run`, I mean in opposite to `walk`.

Replace SuperDrive with SSD HD, preserving original hard disk.

## Thunderbolt -> VGA + DVI + HDMI

If not used this way, I rarely use the minidp port at all.

## USB Brancher: 4 in 1

I got additional mouse, keyboard for extended screen. I have to connect to iPhone, Raspberry Pi, and maybe an Android Phone.

All use USB ports. MacBook Pro only got 2 in total.

Let USB Brancher come to help.

## BlueTooth LE: Magic

The `Magic` mouse I bought is not from Apple, but a factory in Shenzhen, at a quarter price, although without multitouch features, enough for me, at least for now.

That's possible, because Apple opened `BlueTooth LE` channel to the world. No `MFI` certificates are in the way.

Another very nice tip to make full use of MacBook Pro's hardware. What else can it do, with so strict restrictions?

As a bonus, it doesn't occupy physical interface, as well as saving another wireline.

## Firewire

Have not got any good ideas, any recommendations?
