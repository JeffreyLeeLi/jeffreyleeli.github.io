It's younger than most of the classic editors like vim and emacs, but it fits my hands well. Even better than vim did. Let alone emacs, which is obviously not on my diet.

Maybe just because of that fact, it can avoid many common problems with no burden when building, similar to second system effect.

It may not stay in your toolbox forever, but it's absolutely worth **a try**.
