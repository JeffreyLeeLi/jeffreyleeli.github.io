## What tools are to mention?

- Github[ Pages]

- Jekyll[ Bootstrap]

- Markdown

## Why is it smooth?

- I can focus on content creating, without being interrupted by formatting issues

- I can edit, commit and test final result anytime, anywhere, even when I'm offline

- A single sync push click is all it takes to make the rest of the world know

- I'm never concerned with things like: [small little things to worry about, but exact reasons preventing me from walking on feet instead of toes]

	- whether I'm ready to start the scratch
	- what if I made typo mistakes
	- What if web page crashes or server goes down
	- ...

- Everything is tracked and remembered, and can be made to reshow at breeze

- No complex configurations about domains, databases etc.

- Free! In 2 ways:

	- As in freedom: you can choose what you like
	- Also means free beer: there's no fees

- I can embrace the maxim:

	- Perfection is the direction, not the goal
	- You can always approach it, constantly and progressively, never arrive there
