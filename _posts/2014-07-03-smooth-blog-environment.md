## What tools are to mention?

### Github[ Pages]

### Jekyll[ Bootstrap]

### Markdown

## Why is it smooth?

### I can focus on content creating, without being interrupted by formatting issues

### I can edit, commit and test final result anytime, anywhere, even when I'm offline

### A single sync push click is all it takes to make the rest of the world know

### I'm never concerned with things like: [small little things to worry about, but exact reasons preventing me from walking on feet instead of toes]

- whether I'm ready to start the scratch
- what if I made typo mistakes
- What if web page crashes or server goes down
- ...

### No complex configurations about domains, databases etc.

### Free! In 2 ways:

- As in freedom: you can choose what you like
- Also means free beer: there's no fees
